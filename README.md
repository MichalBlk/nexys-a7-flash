# nexys-a7-flash
This is an example design using the S25FL128S QSPI flash on the Nexys A7 FPGA board. The design reads the entire address space byte by byte and prints the read values on the seven-segment displays. The flash controller utilizes the simplest READ command witch transfers data on each rising edge of SCK (so called Single Data Rate). SCK operates at frequency of 50 MHz (which is the maximum frequency for the basic READ command).
